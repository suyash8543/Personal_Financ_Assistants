# Global Financial Compliance & AML Policies

## 1. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Rules
*   **Threshold Monitoring**: Any transaction exceeding $10,000 must be reported to the relevant financial authority (FinCEN in the US) via a Currency Transaction Report (CTR).
*   **Structuring**: Users attempting to bypass the $10,000 threshold by making multiple smaller transactions (e.g., $9,000 + $1,500) are engaging in "structuring," which is a criminal offense.
*   **High-Risk Jurisdictions**: Transactions involving countries on the FATF "Grey List" or "Black List" require Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).

## 2. Know Your Customer (KYC) Requirements
*   **Identity Verification**: All users must provide a government-issued ID and proof of address before being permitted to make international transfers.
*   **Beneficial Ownership**: For corporate accounts, the platform must identify individuals who own more than 25% of the entity.

## 3. Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)
*   **Red Flags**:
    *   Sudden spikes in account activity after long periods of dormancy.
    *   Transactions that have no clear economic or lawful purpose.
    *   Frequent transfers between accounts with no obvious relationship.

## 4. Personalized Financial Advice Guidelines
*   **Fiduciary Duty**: AI must always prioritize the user's financial health, suggesting savings over high-interest debt.
*   **Risk Tolerance**: Investment advice must be Tailored to the user's self-reported risk tolerance (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive).
